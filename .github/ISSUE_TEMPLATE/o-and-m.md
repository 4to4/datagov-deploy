As part of day-to-day operation of Data.gov, there are many [Operation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibilities](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities). Instead of having the entire team watching notifications and risking some notifications slipping through the cracks, we have created an [O&M Triage role](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities#om-triage-rotation). One person on the team is assigned the Triage role which rotates each week. 

In addition to performing triage, here are the things that the person assigned should be focusing on:
